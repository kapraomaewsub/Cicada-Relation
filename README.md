# Cicada-Relation
I make this project to show the relation of my friends, Cicada#2 using my opinion. In other words, I'm building this using the arbitrary threshold, no statistics was used.

### How to view this graph
1. Download the entire repository.
2. Download Obsidian from their [website](https://obsidian.md/).

> Each `md` file is a person. Each bullet in the file is their relations.
